I am a Master’s student at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/de.html) and a student researcher in the [Learning and Adaptive Systems](https://las.inf.ethz.ch) group led by [Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea). Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor’s degree at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/de.html), which included an exchange quater at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu).

My research focuses on developing algorithms that enable more efficient learning and decision-making from large-scale data. Recently, I have worked on sparse-reward reinforcement learning and test-time training. More broadly, I am interested in the mathematical foundations of learning.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
